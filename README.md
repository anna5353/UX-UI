# UX-UI
Hey, my name is Anna and I'll publish here my learning materials and progress in UX/UI design.

I desided to make my first project based on my future business idea: anti-cafe with three different zones.
In all zones client will pay for time, but costs will different for the each zone.
I'm just learning, but I want to make this project as good as I can.

I'll be happy if you like it and leave a review for me.
